HW 3 due tonight - don't add parentheses


(p ∨ q) ∨ r

vs

p ∨ (q ∨ r)   ??

/////////////

no new homework this week

Exam 1 is Thursday, February 13

////////////////////////////////

Today:
- Finish proof of distributive law
- Implies elimination
- Exam 1 review

////////////////////////////////

Proving equivalence with natural deduction?

first |- second

AND

second |- first

////////////////////////////////

Example: prove one of the distributive laws

p ∨ (q ∧ r)     is equivalent to       (p ∨ q) ∧ (p ∨ r)



Already did on Thursday:

    (p ∨ q) ∧ (p ∨ r) ⊢  p ∨ (q ∧ r)




What is left?




(finish orDist2.sc)


////////////////////////////////

if (extraCredit == true || grade < 90) {
    if (extraCredit == true || grade >= 80) {
        //do stuff
    }
}


--> how does the distributive law tell us we can rewrite this?


////////////////////////////////

Implies-elimination, ImplyE

          P, P → Q
ImplyE: -----------
            Q



(This rule is also called "modus ponens")

Example:

//Suppose we know x > 5. What can we conclude?

if (x > 5) {
    y = 17;
}

///////////////////////////////

Syntax for using ImplyE:

a ( P       )   by Justification,
b ( P → Q   )   by Justification,
c ( Q       )   by ImplyE(b, a)

__>:

////////////////////////////////////////

Example (imply1.sc):

(p ∧ q) → r,  p → q,  p  ⊢ r



Example (imply2.logika):

p → r,  q → r,  p ∨ q  ⊢ r

Exam 1 review.

Covers everything we've done up to this point (including today).

See Canvas announcement for list of topics.




How to prove two propositional logic statements are equivalent?

    Approach 1:
        two deduction proofs, where they flip which one is the premise and other is conclusion
    Approach 2:
        truth table, can be "combined", w/ both statements in the same table
        show both statements have same outputs for every possible input

How to prove propositional logic statements are NOT equivalent?
    1 truth assignement where the outputs are different


What is satisfiability? 
    true at least once

- Determining whether an argument is valid or invalid
    (what is an argument?)

    how prove valid?
        truth table?
        
    how prove invalid?
        1 case where cases are true, but conclusion is false
        

/////////////////////////////////////////

Closed notes/computers.


All problems will be "open-ended" - similar in content/format
to HW problems.


Some problems will ask for a proof or explanation --
    read carefully!
