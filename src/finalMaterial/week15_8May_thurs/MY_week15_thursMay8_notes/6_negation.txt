Suppose we have the following predicates:

P(x, y): person x is partners with person y
CS(x): person x is a CS major
ECE(x): person x is an ECE major
KS(x): person x is from Kansas


For each statement:
a) Translate it to English
b) Negate it, showing your work (any OR statement should be converted to an ->)
c) Translate your negation to English


1. ∀ x (KS(x) V ¬CS(x))

Translation: Every person is from kansas or not CS majors

Negation: 
    !(∀ x (KS(x) V ¬CS(x)))
    E x !(KS(x) V !CS(x))
    E x (!KS(x) & CS(x))

Translation of negation:
    Theres someone who doesnt live in Kansas and is a CS major



2. ∃ x (ECE(x) ^ ∀ y (KS(y) → P(x, y)))

Translation: 

Negation:
